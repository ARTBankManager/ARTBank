# AR Test Bank

AR Test Bank is a set of Google AR Core Playback videos that can be used as a benchmark for AR techniques and a test suite for AR apps. It contains videos of controlled environments where cameras are placed at different distances, angles, heights, and with different movements relatively to placement marks, as well as videos of wild environments where a large variety of scenes are covered. 

It is a collaborative project of the University of Texas at San Antonio and Rochester Institute of Technology. We welcome contributions from the public to enhance this dataset.
